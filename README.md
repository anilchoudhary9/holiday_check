# Frontend Assignment

### Please implement page in software stack of your choice with the following requirements:

* Assume that you have data already returned from JSON service. Structure of that JSON is up to you.
* Font used is Open Sans - you will find it on Google Fonts.
* Thumbs up / thumbs down / stars are all part of Font Awesome.
* You don't have to use exact user pictures, you can grab random ones from e.g. https://randomuser.me/
* Header background image - pick whatever you want from Flicker or similar.
* It's only client side "application" (we used quotes, because it's only one page - hard to call it "application" ;)
* It doesn't have to render on a server.
* HTML/Component (if used) structure is totally up to you.
* All required assets are located in assets folder ( logo + design )

Have fun!
